## About Me

I'm a final-year student at the University of Waterloo, pursuing a Bachelor of Mathematics with a deep passion for numbers and patterns. My academic journey has led me into the fascinating realms of Mathematical Finance and Statistics, while I've also honed my technical skills through a minor in Computing. Beyond my studies, I actively engage in the Computer Science and Data Science Club, reflecting my commitment to continuous learning and community involvement.

My curiosity in Quantitative Trading, Data Science, and the transformative power of ML/AI drives my academic pursuits. I thrive on challenges and the excitement of transforming complex data into insightful, strategic decisions.
